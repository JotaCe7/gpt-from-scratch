    "In an attention mechanism, the dot products between query and key vectors can become very large, especially when the embedding dimension (`d_k`) is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original transformer paper (\"Attention Is All You Need\") showed that for query and key vectors with a mean of 0 and variance of 1, the dot product has a mean of 0 but a variance of `d_k`. To counteract this, they proposed dividing the attention scores by the <b>square root of the key dimension</b>, $\\sqrt{d_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scaling ensures that the variance of the attention scores remains at 1, regardless of the embedding dimension. It keeps the inputs to the softmax function in a well-behaved range, leading to more stable gradients and smoother training.\n",

    "A common challenge when training large neural networks is <b>overfitting</b>. This happens when a model learns the training data <i>too well</i> —including its noise and specific quirks— and then fails to generalize to new, unseen examples. To combat overfitting, we use techniques called <b>regularization</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dropout</b> is one of the most effective and widely used regularization methods in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Dropout Works\n",
    "During each training step, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neuron activations or weights to zero. This forces the network to learn more robust and redundant representations because it cannot become too reliant on any single connection or feature, as it might be \"dropped out\" at any moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "  <b>Analogy: A Team of Experts</b><br>\n",
    "  Imagine a team of experts solving a problem. If the same experts are always available, they might start relying too heavily on each other's specific knowledge. Dropout is like telling some experts to randomly take a break for each task. The remaining team members are forced to learn how to cover for them and develop a wider range of skills, making the whole team more robust.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying dropout to the attention weights, we prevent the attention mechanism from \"overfitting\" on specific token-to-token relationships it sees in the training data. It encourages the model to learn more diverse ways of gathering context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how it works in practice, let's first apply dropout to a simple matrix of ones. We'll use a high dropout rate of 50% (`p=0.5`) for this demonstration to make its effect obvious. Note that dropout is **only active during training** and is automatically disabled during evaluation (`model.eval()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train the GPT model in later chapters, we will use a lower dropout rate, such as 0.1 or 0.2.\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation of the MultiHead Attention Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MultiHeadAttention` class we just defined may look complicated due to the tensor reshaping and transposing, but it's a highly optimized and standard way to implement the mechanism. Let's break down how it works and why it's more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Approaches to Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The \"Wrapper\" Approach (Conceptually Simpler):** Our previous `MultiHeadAttentionWrapper` class was easy to understand. It created multiple, separate `CausalAttention` objects and concatenated their results. While clear, this approach is inefficient because it requires running a separate set of matrix multiplications for each head.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The \"Integrated\" Approach (More Efficient):** This new `MultiHeadAttention` class takes a more integrated approach. It performs one single, large matrix multiplication to get the queries, keys, and values for all heads at once. Then, it uses clever tensor reshaping to \"split\" these large tensors into virtual heads for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Deep Dive into the Tensor Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` pass of this class achieves its efficiency through a precise sequence of tensor manipulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Projection:** The input `x` (shape `[batch_size, num_tokens, d_in]`) is passed through the three large `W_query`, `W_key`, and `W_value` linear layers. This produces the initial `queries`, `keys`, and `values` tensors, each with shape `[batch_size, num_tokens, d_out]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Splitting the Heads:** The `.view()` method reshapes each tensor to add the `num_heads` dimension. It effectively unrolls the `d_out` dimension into `num_heads` and `head_dim` (where `d_out = num_heads * head_dim`). The new shape is `[batch_size, num_tokens, num_heads, head_dim]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Transposing for Calculation:** To perform the attention calculation across all heads simultaneously, PyTorch's `matmul` (`@`) operator requires the dimensions being multiplied to be the last two. We use `.transpose(1, 2)` to swap the `num_tokens` and `num_heads` dimensions. The resulting shape is `[batch_size, num_heads, num_tokens, head_dim]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Computing Attention:** With the tensors in the correct shape, we can now compute the scaled dot-product attention (`queries @ keys.transpose(-2, -1)`). This calculation happens independently and in parallel for all heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Combining the Heads:** After the attention weights are applied to the `values`, the process is reversed. The tensor is transposed back to `[batch_size, num_tokens, num_heads, head_dim]`, and then `.view()` is used to flatten the last two dimensions back into the single `d_out` dimension, resulting in a final shape of `[batch_size, num_tokens, d_out]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of the Final Projection Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed the extra `self.out_proj` layer at the end. This final linear layer is not strictly necessary, but it's a standard part of the transformer architecture. Its purpose is to take the concatenated outputs from all the attention heads and learn the best way to combine and mix their information into a final, cohesive output vector.\n",
